  <h1 style="margin-top:200px;"> WHY we need women in Tech? </h1>
  <div class = "text"> 
    <p> <em> Many of you might be wondering why is that we are encouraging women to be in tech? </em></p>
    <h3> Here are the reasons why: </h3>
    <section><h5> 1. Diversity Generates More Revenue </h5> 
    <p> Compared to their peers, high-gender-diversity companies deliver slightly better returns, and they have outperformed, on average, less diverse companies over the past five years. Companies that not only hire but also manage to retain more women put themselves in a position to automatically gain a competitive advantage, a benefit that extends to all stakeholders.
    </p> 
    <br\> 
    <section><h5> 2. Women Think Differently </h5>
    <p> By nature, interacting with a diverse team forces individuals to prepare better and anticipate alternative viewpoints. The presence of women makes individuals anticipate differences in opinion and perspective and makes them assume that they will need to work harder to come to a consensus. We can all benefit from that kind of pressure.</p>
    <p>Men and women see things differently and bring unique ideas to the table. This enables better problem solving, which can boost performance at the business unit level. Imagine all of the buying power you will tap into by bringing together a mix of genders with various backgrounds and ethnicities. Better yet, after your company gains a reputation of having a more diverse workforce, you also gain an extremely powerful recruiting tool at your disposal.</p>
    <br\> 
    <section><h5> 3. We Need More Role Models </h5>
    <p> By celebrating female tech leaders, it will hopefully encourage more girls to pursue their interests and careers in tech, thus increasing the hiring pool diversity. We need to ensure young girls have strong role models of other successful women in STEM and that women have a seat at the table so they can engage men on the topic of gender equality.</p>
